      <description>My name is Erdogan Tufa.
I&amp;rsquo;m a full-stack .NET developer who is passionate about design patterns (in the real world), SOLID principles, and clean code practices.
Testimonials  Giovanni Degiorgi Business Analyst
I had the pleasure to work with Erdo for several projects, starting from simple webpage to more complex server client architectures. He is confident about technical concepts definition as well as the execution of the real work. All problems encountered during the development were solved easily by him and in no case I had the feeling he wasn’t in control of the project.</description>
