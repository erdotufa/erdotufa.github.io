      <description>In this historical moment with this global situation in the “pandemic world”, I saw most people doing some things without sense. One of these that I did was to watch again “The neverending story” movie by Michael Ende. At first I was watching it like a story for children, in the same mode of when I was young. But at some point of the story, during the conversation between the Bad Gmork and the Warrior Atreyu, I had an intuition: maybe the movie wasn’t for children at all, but it was a hidden deeper message for humanity.</description>
